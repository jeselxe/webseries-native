# Webseries native

Native client of [Webseries API](https://github.com/jeselxe/WebSeries) made with [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) for:

* iOS
* Android *(in progress)*

## Getting Started

#### Android

Open an emulator or connect a device and then run `react-native run-android` to install the app on it.

> *Warning!* Android app is not done yet
